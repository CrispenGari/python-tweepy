    "### Introduction\n",
    "Sentiment analyis (SA) is a supervised or unsupervised machine learning task for classifying the popularity of a given text. Given a text and labels a model can be trained to classify the category the text belongs to for example it can classify wether a given text fall under `positive`, `negative` or `neutral`. SA can be either a multi-class classification or a binary classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "Sentiment analyisis is a very useful study in modern technology. SA goal is to study human opinion over written text of natural languages. Natural languages are languages that are spoken by people, unlike programming language natural languages comes natural for example Xhosa, English, French etc. SA can analyise human emotions, attitude, opinion, sentiments over a written language. This study is very useful in systems like chatbots and virtual assistance in making decisions when interacting with human beings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_In this notebook I'm going to implement and train a model from scratch using modern python libraries such as `tensorflow` by `google` that does a general sentiment analyisis classification task based on `3` class labels (`positive`, `negative`, `neutral`). Each code cell that we are going to execute will be explained by the use of `Markdown` that's why I choose `.ipyb` or `IPython` notebook to write code for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that I will be using for this supervised matchine learning task was scraped using the twitter api from the previous notebook.The processing and loading of data will be done step by step in this notebook so that it can be easily understood and can be explained easily in simple terms._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP), Embeddings, Loss, Accuracy, Sentiment Analysis, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Dropout, Gated Reccurent Unit (GRU), Bi-Directional, Dataset, Overfitting, Confusion Matrix, Inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloud File System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an instance of a cloud notebook (Google Colab) notebook where we can write code in the browser without installing any packages or any programming language. Alternatively one can use `Jupyter Notebooks` to perform this task but for speed we may consider using something like `Google Colab` because it offers free `Graphic Processing Units (GPU)` and `Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)`. These devices or runtime environments allows our code to execute fast because they are good when it comes to mathematical computations as compared to `Central Processing Units (CPU)`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are using `Google Colab` you might as well think of accessing your file system. Fortunate enough google made it easy for developers because there's an `API` that allows us to directly link our `Google Drive` cloud storage with `Google Colab`. Also most of the datascientists use the API like `Kaggle` to access the dataset without bothering uploading the dataset in the google drive storage. The following shows how our file system looks like in the google drive.\n",

    "        - glove.6B.100d.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "> Note that I have downloaded the [sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) dataset from kaggle and uploaded it on my google drive. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have the `data.csv` which is the dataset that we will be working with and the `glove.6B.100d.txt` will look at it later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phyiscal Devices\n",
    "As i mentioned before that we are going to make use of free `GPU` we need to make sure that the change the runtime type by clicking on the `Runtime` menu > `Change Runtime Type` > `GPU`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mounting the Drive\n",
    "In order to use the google drive in google colab we have to mount it and give google colab access to our google drive storage. We can mount the drive by running the following code cell.\n",

    "4. `prettytable` - provide an api for nice visualization of tables\n",
    "5. `pandas` - for working with dataframes\n",
    "6. `sklearn` - offers some classes and functions that helps us to easily work with `2d` or `1d` data for example we can use the `tran_test_split` method from `sklearn` model selection to split examples into subsets.\n",
    "7. `nltk` - stands for `natural language tool kit` an nlp module that offers us with some functions such as `word_tokenize` for tokenizing a sentence into a list or array of words. \n",
    "8. `numpy` - numerical python, this package allows us to simply work with arrays very easily in python. Good news is that tensorflow keras can also work with these arrays directly instead of tensorflow tensors.\n",
    "9. `spacy` - spaCy is a free open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python.\n",
    "10. `seaborn` - this package is used to do some colorful chats visualizations\n",

    "### Preparing Features(texts) and Labels(labels) for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning/machine learning model does not take in raw data such as text. We need to convert text to a sequence of integer representation and have a word to index lookup for a word to an integer also known as a `vocabulary`. Our labels will be processed based on the loss function that we are going to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Note that this is a simple multi-lable clasification becauses we are classiying weather a sentiment is `positive`, `neutral` or  `negative`. The best loss function to use for this supervised machine leaning task is `CategoricalCrossEntropy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tensorflow/keras there are a lot of loss function that you can read more about them [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses). The most common loss functions for classification tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [`BinaryCrossentropy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/BinaryCrossentropy)\n",
    "\n",
    "* This loss function compute the cross-entropy loss between true labels and predicted values. Note that the labels must be integer numbers. This loss only works when we have binary labels `0` or `1` meaning the label must be that label or the other one (True or False). For example `positive` or `negative`. This is not a good loss function for our task because we have `3` labels, positive, neutral or nagative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [`CategoricalCrossentropy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/BinaryFocalCrossentropy)\n",
    "\n",
    "* I call this loss function flexible. This can either work on sparse labels or binary labels irrespective of efficiency. This is a good fit to our task because we have 3 target labels in our dataset. Categorical Cross entropy Loss function compute the entropy loss between real labels and predicted labels. This loss function as the name suggest it is used on categorical labels. A good use case is  when you have more that two class labels or when your class labels are `dense`. I am going to use this loss function because this is a good fit for our 3 targets classed. Categorical Cross Entropy loss functions in `tensorflow.keras` expects labels to be `one-hot` encoded vectors. We are going to `one_hot_encode` our labels. The rules are very simple when working with this loss function in `tensorflow.keras`. _\"It expects the labels to be `one_hot` encoded\"_-rep.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One hot encoding can be defined as the essential process of converting the categorical data variables to be provided to machine and deep learning algorithms which in turn improve predictions as well as classification accuracy of a model. It is called `one_hot` because on a processed label, there will be a vector of `0's` where only the true label index will have a value of `1`. Not clear ok?? Let's have a look at our case where we have 3 classes (neutral = 0, negative=1, positive=2) our class label will look as follows for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* negative\n",
    "```py\n",
    "[0. 1. 0.]  # only index 1 is hot which is our -ve label\n",
    "```\n",
    "* positive\n",
    "```py\n",
    "[0. 0. 1.]  # only index 2 is hot which is our +ve label\n",
    "```\n",
    "* neutral\n",
    "```py\n",
    "[0. 0. 1.]  # only index 0 is hot which is our neutral label\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> _During processing of our labels we will want to `one_hot` encode them as shown above_. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use different method to do this task for example using the `sklearn` libary or using the `tf.one_hot()` function from tensorflow. But the one i like the most is to do it manualy using the `np.eye()` function which looks more proffesional to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [`SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/SparseCategoricalCrossentropy)\n",
    "* This loss function is normally used on sparse data and it computes the crossentropy loss between true labels and predictions. Let's say we have `100` labels that we need to classify. In this case we can not use the `BinaryCrossentropy` loss function because this only works if we have two label outcome for example `True` or `False`, `Positive` or `Nagative`. Alternatively we can use the `CategoricalCrossentropy` loss but this loss function is not a good fit for the task because it expect the labels to be `sparse` and these labels are expected as integers and can not be on-hot-encoded because having a `100` dimension sparse vector will be a huge computation and it's not memory and time efficient for model training."

There are a lot of language models that can be used to tokenize the words, for example there are tokenizer model for english, germany, french, etc languages. Alternatively you can create your own tokenizer model by just using the `split(delimeter)` string function in python and pass the delimeter as a `space/(' ')`.

Fortunately we have a method called `pad_sequences` from `keras.preprocessing.sequence` that does that for us out of a fly.

    "### Word Embeddings\n",
    "Embeddings transform a `one-hot` encoded vector (a vector that is 0 in elements except one, which is 1) into a much smaller dimension vector of real numbers. The `one-hot` encoded vector is also known as a `sparse vector`, whilst the real valued vector is known as a `dense vector`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concept in these word embeddings is that words that appear in similar contexts appear nearby in the vector space, i.e. the **Euclidean distance** between these two word vectors is small. By context here, we mean the surrounding words. For example in the sentences `\"I purchased some items at the shop\"` and `\"I purchased some items at the store\"` the words `'shop'` and `'store'` appear in the same context and thus should be close together in vector space, this means that the **Euclidean distance** between the word `shop` and `store` is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you want to read more about word embeddings you can visit this notebook [CrispenGari/pytorch-python](https://github.com/CrispenGari/pytorch-python/blob/main/09_NLP/02_Sentiment_Analyisis_Series/10_A_closer_look_on_Word_Embeddings.ipynb) for better understanding in theory.\n",

    "If you are an expert in NLP you may have heard that `'woman'` added to the vector of `'king'` minus the vector of `'man'` give us `'queen'`. \n",

    "\n",
    "If we think about it, the vector calculated from `'king'` minus `'man'` gives us a `\"royalty vector\"`. This is the vector associated with traveling from a man to his royal counterpart, a king. If we add this `\"royality vector\"` to `'woman'`, this should travel to her royal equivalent, which is a `queen`! \n",

    "Now that we have our data ready for model creation and that we have our embedding weights ready to be used next we are going to build a classification model using `tensorflow.keras`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will be a very simple classification model. There are three ways of building a model in tensorflow keras. These ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequential API\n",
    "2. Functional API\n",
    "3. Sub Class API\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook we are going to use the `SubClass` API the reason i choose this method over other methods it's because of it's flexibility when building deep learning models in `tesnorflow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to create a `Bi-Directional RNN` model for text classification. I'm not going to explain the mathematical theory that much in this presentation but you can read more about what the input shape does `RNN` (Recurrent Nueral Networks) accepts [CrispenGari/pytorch-python](https://github.com/CrispenGari/pytorch-python/blob/main/09_NLP/02_Sentiment_Analyisis_Series/01_Simple_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Recurrent Nueral Networks (RNN)\n",
    "These are nothing but layers that comes from the `keras.Layers` which are commonly used and seems to be good in processing `sequential` data. These layers are used mostly in `audio` processing, `time-series` or `text-sequences`. These layers are a good fit to our case because we are working with sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to make use of an `RNN` achitecture called `Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is an LSTM better than a standard RNN? \n",
    "\n",
    "Standard `RNNs` suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. `LSTMs` overcome this by having an extra recurrent state called a `cell`, which can be thought of as the \"memory\" of the LSTM and the use use multiple gates which control the flow of information into and out of the memory. If you want to know the mathematics or clear explanation about these layers you can read them here [CrispenGari/pytorch-python](https://github.com/CrispenGari/pytorch-python/blob/main/09_NLP/02_Sentiment_Analyisis_Series/02_Updated_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bidirectional `LSTM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind a bidirectional RNN is simple. As well as having an RNN processing the words in the sentence from the first to the last (a forward RNN), we have a second RNN processing the words in the sentence from the last to the first (a backward RNN). In our model we are going to have a  Gated Reccurrent Unit (GRU) as our backward RNN and an LSTM as our forward RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization\n",
    "Without going into overfitting into too much detail, the more parameters you have in in your model, the higher the probability that your model will overfit (memorize the training data, causing a low training error but high validation/testing error, i.e. poor generalization to new, unseen examples). To combat this, we use regularization. More specifically, we use a method of regularization called dropout. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Dropout` works by randomly dropping out (setting to 0) neurons in a layer during a forward pass. The probability that each neuron is dropped out is set by a hyperparameter and each neuron with dropout applied is considered indepenently. One theory about why dropout works is that a model with parameters dropped out can be seen as a \"weaker\" (less parameters) model. The predictions from all these \"weaker\" models (one for each forward pass) get averaged together withinin the parameters of the model. Thus, your one model can be thought of as an ensemble of weaker models, none of which are over-parameterized and thus should not overfit.\n",
