Negation words reverse the polarity. TextBlob has semantic labels that help with fine-grained analysis. For example — emoticons, exclamation mark, emojis, etc. Subjectivity lies between `[0,1]`. Subjectivity quantifies the amount of personal opinion and factual information contained in the text. The higher subjectivity means that the text contains personal opinion rather than factual information. TextBlob has one more parameter — intensity. TextBlob calculates subjectivity by looking at the ‘intensity’. Intensity determines if a word modifies the next word. For English, adverbs are used as modifiers (‘very good’).\n",

We are going to create a preprocessing function that will be able to remove all hashtags, mentions, urls, numbers as well as expanding the words like `I'm` to `I am` so that we make our text so clean. We are also going to remove single letter that means nothing and convert everything word to lowercase for example let's have a look at the following sentence :\n",

It helps us to reduce noise in our features so that our model instead of forcusing on learning numbers, hashtags and mentions it will just focus on the text which is what maters. This also reduces the size of the `vocabulary`. In NLP we have an important consept called `vocabulary` which i'm going to explain it more about it later in the model training notebook. But we must know that text cleaning reduces the size of the vocabulary and improve the model training speed."
